"""
c2b requires registering validation(optional) and confirmation url in order to send
payment information during a transaction.
you only need to register once, so find a way to call this function only once.

I made an endpoint that will be protected, only admin is allowed to send a get request to it
so that he can register the url. 
In production, this function needs only to be called once. we might remove it or make a script to 
run it separately. but for now send a get request to /register-urls
